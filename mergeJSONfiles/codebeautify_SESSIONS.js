					"SessionDescription": "Neutrophils are the first leukocytes recruited to sites of infection or injury. A newly recognized component in their arsenal of responses is the release of nuclear DNA to generate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are web-like structures composed of decondensed chromatin coated with neutrophil nuclear, granule, and cytoplasmic proteins. Since first described in 2004 by investigators studying neutrophils activated <i>in vitro</i>, the regulation and clinical relevance of NETosis has attracted broad attention, yet many fundamental knowledge gaps remain. Mechanisms leading to NET formation are only partially understood, and include deimination of histones by peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). Released NETs can trap microbes and may contribute to host defense, but the importance of this function is controversial. NETs can also cause proinflammatory damage to host tissues, and the NETs themselves are highly proinflammatory and prothrombotic. </p>\n<p>Dr. Christian Yost will provide an overview of NETosis and its proposed beneficial effects and adverse consequences. He will present recent studies of human neonates leading to discovery of a family of peptide inhibitors of NETosis. Investigation of the activities of these inhibitors is relevant to the inflammatory biology of neonates and adults, and may lead to new therapeutic strategies to harness NET formation.</p>\n<p>Dr. Denisa Wagner will discuss the evidence supporting an important role of NETs in thrombosis and inflammation. Mice lacking PAD4 or mice treated with deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I are protected from venous thrombosis and aging-associated fibrosis, and develop smaller post-ischemic cardiac infarcts. Dr. Wagner will propose why PAD4 and NETs will be an interesting drug target in thrombotic and cardiovascular disease.",

					"SessionDescription": "<h3>ASH Mentor Award</h3>\n<p>The ASH Mentor Award was established to recognize hematologists who have excelled in mentoring trainees and colleagues. Each year the Society recognizes two outstanding mentors drawn from the areas of basic science, clinical investigation, education, or clinical/community care who have had a significant, positive impact on their mentees' careers and, through their mentees, have advanced research and patient care in the field of hematology.</p>\n<p><strong>Ronald Hoffman, MD,</strong> is currently the Albert A. and Vera G. List Professor of Medicine, Director of the Myeloproliferative Diseases Research Program, and Professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology-Oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. Dr. Hoffman was nominated for the ASH Mentor Award by the Nominations and Awards Committee of the Department of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who noted that his greatest legacy resides in his devotion to the cause of mentoring. Dr. Hoffman decisively shaped the careers of 33 fellows or junior faculty, many of them rising to positions of great prominence within academic medical centers, some who are now leaders of Divisions and Departments. His mentees attest to the essential role he has played, and continues to play, in their careers. Dr. Hoffman has been a very active member of ASH and during his tenure as ASH President, he helped to establish the Minority Recruitment Initiative that has led to retention and mentoring of many underrepresented minorities in hematology and serves as the foundation of ASH's dedication to diversifying the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Oliver W. Press, MD, PhD,</strong> is Professor of Medicine and Adjunct Professor of Bioengineering at University of Washington. He also serves as the Acting Senior Vice President at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. Dr. Press has a long and consistent history of impacting the careers of a large number of mentees. He has mentored over 70 pre- and post-doc fellows and medical students since 1980s and remains committed to their career development, which he sees as a continuing process. His mentees uniformly cite his exceeding generosity of time and his dedication to his mentorship activities having positively influenced them. Dr. Press has played a large role in advancing his mentees' careers, many have successfully received career development grants and have gone on to become leaders in academic medicine and pharmaceutical companies. He is also cited for the value he places on work-life balance, patients, personal connections and the importance of professionalism. Dr. Press has been working with the mentoring committee at his institution to develop a sustainable and enduring mentoring infrastructure at his center.</p>\n<h3>ASH Award for Leadership in Promoting Diversity</h3>\n<p><span>The ASH Award for Leadership in Promoting Diversity honors hematologists who have supported the development of an inclusive hematology workforce, who have encouraged the career development of underrepresented minority trainees, or who have made the commitment to inclusiveness in contributions to the mission of ASH.</span></p>\n<p><b>The inaugural ASH Award for Leadership in Promoting Diversity will be awarded to Betty Pace, MD, of Augusta University.</b> Dr. Pace is Professor of Pediatrics, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology, the Frances Tedesco Chair, Interim Chief of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, and the Director of the Sickle Cell Program. She is a physician scientist and prominent national figure in sickle cell disease research who has dedicated countless hours to mentoring and promoting diversity in hematology research for more than two decades. From early in her career, she worked to attract students from high schools and undergraduate programs to biomedical research. She has since created a talent pipeline of trainees, especially from underrepresented groups, to further diversify the workforce. Among the 80 individuals trained in the Pace Lab, 45 percent have been underrepresented minorities, including African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. Additionally, sixty percent of her publications and reviews have included minority trainees and collaborators. Dr. Pace has worked extensively for ASH as a mentor for the Minority Medical Student Award Program (MMSAP) and member of the Committee on Promoting Diversity. </p>\n<h3>ASH Outstanding Service Award</h3>\n<p>The Outstanding Service Award is presented to an individual who has worked tirelessly to raise public awareness and increase research funding for hematologic diseases. <b> <br /></b></p>\n<p><strong>Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. </strong></p>\n<p>Prior to becoming the 47<sup>th</sup> Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden represented the state of Delaware in the U.S. Senate for 36 years. Following the death of his son from brain cancer, Vice President Biden led the Obama Administration's Cancer Moonshot to accelerate cancer research. Under his leadership, the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force catalyzed collaborations among 20 government agencies, departments, and White House offices and more than 70 private sector collaborations designed to achieve a decades' worth of progress in five years in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. In 2017, President Obama presented Vice President Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction for his service to the United States, including his leadership on the Cancer Moonshot effort. Vice President Biden has pledged to continue his efforts to support cancer research and the Moonshot through the Biden Foundation, which he and his wife founded after leaving public service in January 2017.</p>\n<h3>ASH Public Service Award</h3>\n<p>The ASH Public Service Award is presented annually to an elected public official who has demonstrated unparalleled leadership on issues of importance to hematology research and/or practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Tom Brokaw</strong></p>\n<p>The 2017 recipient of the ASH Outstanding Service Award is former NBC Nightly News anchor, Tom Brokaw, for his dedication to increasing public awareness about cancer and the need for additional research funding since his diagnosis with multiple myeloma. Mr. Brokaw has shared his personal cancer experience in his book <em>A Lucky Life Interrupted</em> and in essays in <em>The New York Times</em> and other publications, providing an example not only for patients, but also for their families, of how to best deal with their disease. He has also shared his story at numerous events throughout the country, listening to the stories of countless patients and helping them acquire access to specialized care.</p>\n<h3>Wallace H. Coulter Award for Lifetime Achievement in Hematology</h3>\n<p>Wallace H. Coulter was a prolific inventor, innovator, and entrepreneur. His Coulter Principle pioneered the development of flow cytometry, defined particle characterization, and made possible automated hematology, thus revolutionizing laboratory medicine. The Coulter Counter led to major breakthroughs in science, medicine, and industry. This award, in his name, recognizes an individual who has demonstrated a lasting commitment to the field of hematology through outstanding contributions to education, research, and practice.<b></b></p>\n<p><strong>The 2017 Wallace H. Coulter Award for Lifetime Achievement in Hematology will recognize Marshall A. Lichtman, MD,</strong> of University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Dr. Lichtman is internationally renowned as an educator, mentor, and researcher and is revered as a compassionate, extremely knowledgeable and skillful physician and teacher. He is consulted frequently for advice on the diagnosis or management of the most complex hematologic problems. The breadth of his expertise is documented in his 375 publications, which include a broad reach of observations in the leukemias, lymphomas, hemolytic anemias, and other blood cell disorders. His 30 years of research funding encompassed studies of blood cell membrane biochemistry and physiology, blood cell ionic and amino acid transport, hemoglobin function, hematopoiesis, blood rheology, and leukocyte physiology and pathophysiology. His research articles appeared in high impact journals and he presented his work at an ASH Presidential Symposium in the 1970s.",

					"SessionDescription": "<h3>William Dameshek Prize</h3>\n<p>The William Dameshek Prize, named for the late William Dameshek, MD, a past president of ASH and the original editor of <em>Blood</em>, recognizes an early- or mid-career individual who has made a recent outstanding contribution to the field of hematology.</p>\n<p><strong>The 2017 William Dameshek Prize will be awarded to Benjamin Ebert, MD, PhD</strong>, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA, for his seminal discoveries in multiple areas of malignant hematology. Dr. Ebert has been noted for his leadership role in describing the genomic landscape of adult myelodysplastic syndromes. His lab has made significant contributions to understanding the biological basis of transformation of hematopoietic cells by somatic mutations. Dr. Ebert also published the first studies on CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in hematopoietic stem cells to create novel models of hematologic malignancy. His work has displayed creativity, innovative methodology, and most importantly, direct human relevance. Many of his findings have been directly translated to the clinic as diagnostic tests or therapeutic targets.</p>\n<h3>Henry M. Stratton Medal</h3>\n<p>The Henry M. Stratton Medal is named after the late Henry Maurice Stratton, co-founder of Grune and Stratton, the medical publishing house that first published ASH’s journal <em>Blood</em>. The prize honors two senior investigators whose contributions to both basic and clinical/ translational hematology research are well recognized and have taken place over a period of several years.</p>\n<p><strong>The 2017 Henry M. Stratton Medal for Basic Research will be awarded to Josef Prchal, MD</strong>, of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT, for his contributions to the fundamental understanding of both primary and secondary polycythemias. Dr. Prchal’s many innovations in the field include the description of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutation in recessive Chuvash familial polycythemia and elaboration on the pathobiology of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) mutations in autosomal dominant familial polycythemia. His genetic investigations of acquired polycythemia vera led to the association of chromosome 9p abnormalities – where the JAK2 gene is located – with the disease. More recently, Dr. Prchal and his collaborators showed that Tibetans are protected from high altitude polycythemia as a result of a high altitude genetic adaptation due to a variant EGLN1 gene.</p>\n<p><strong>The 2017 Henry M. Stratton Medal for Clinical/Translational Research will be awarded to Sherrill Slichter, MD</strong>, of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, WA, for her major contributions to the field of transfusion medicine over a period of more than 40 years. Dr. Slichter’s research contributions include the evaluation of methodologies for platelet storage prior to transfusion, the development of guidelines for prophylactic platelet transfusion, pre-transfusion treatment of platelets to reduce immunogenicity, the characterization of platelet kinetics in various disease states, especially autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and the evaluation of various commercial systems for preservation of platelets and other blood cells prior to transfusion. Her research efforts have helped improve current standards of platelet preservation and transfusion around the world, culminating in the execution of a large clinical study that provided an objective threshold for platelet transfusion. Her studies have also been critical to optimizing transfusion practices.",

In 2015, <i>ASH Clinical News</i> reported in \"Beating Burnout: When Clinicians Are Overworked, Overtired, and Overwhelmed\" that the most common complaints among today’s practicing hematologists are delayed, inadequate, and reduced reimbursement, high staff turnover, poor recruitment and retention, and understaffing – all causes of burnout. Reports indicate that the advent of electronic health records and federal reporting mandates have added to physician burnout and that the implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) has the potential to create additional burden, especially for small practices lacking in administrative resources.

Dr. Zhang will provide examples to demonstrate the power of these approaches for research discovery and real-time clinical application.</p>\n<p>Dr. Ernest Turro will discuss statistical and genomic approaches in rare disease research. He will describe recently developed methods that address statistical challenges of identifying causative associations in rare diseases, including power issues, phenotypic heterogeneity, and unknown modes of inheritance. Dr. Turro will describe how cell-specific genomic assays of patient and control samples allow researchers to constrain the large hypothesis space explored by unbiased genome-wide analyses and permit construction of a focused map of the most functionally important coding and regulatory loci, enabling an efficient identification of pathogenic variants. He will demonstrate the value of integrating transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and epigenomic (ChIP-seq) profiling of cell types pertinent to hereditary bleeding and platelet disorders.",

					"SessionDescription": "Scientifically and clinically, the study of blood commands a professional engagement that can lead hematologists to lose sight of the complex notions held by the non-medical world. This session will showcase art historian Amy E. Herman, whose work shines a unique light on the intersection of medicine and humanity. In her celebrated seminar, <i>The Art of Perception</i>, Ms. Herman has trained experts from many fields how to perceive and communicate better. By showing people how to look closely at images, she helps them hone their visual intelligence, a set of skills all individuals possess but that few know how to use effectively. Ms. Herman has spent more than a decade teaching doctors to observe patients instead of their charts, helping police officers separate facts from opinions when investigating a crime, and training professionals from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department, Fortune 500 companies, and the military to recognize the most pertinent and useful information. Her lessons highlight far more than the physical objects you may be missing; they teach you how to recognize visual clues. Ms. developed and conducts all sessions of <i>The Art of Perception</i> using the analysis of works of art to improve perception and communication.",

Emerging data indicate that between 90 and 95 percent of patients with early myeloma (smoldering myeloma) can achieve complete responses and MRD negativity.

					"SessionDescription": "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 that result in severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. TTP usually remits when treated with plasma exchange, however, patients tend to relapse if the autoantibodies persist. Immunosuppression with rituximab can prevent most of these relapses, whether given to all patients at the time of presentation or reserved for disease that is refractory to plasma exchange. The efficacy of rituximab in these settings raises the question of whether patients with asymptomatic severe ADAMTS13 deficiency should be treated preemptively to prevent future relapses. Answering this question depends on understanding both the risk of relapse associated with persistent severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and the risk of adverse events associated with rituximab or other immunosuppressive regimens. Most patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency relapse fairly quickly, but some remain asymptomatic for years. Most patients tolerate rituximab well, but rare patients experience serious adverse events that can be fatal, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Some hematologists believe that the data available already justify preemptive treatment to restore ADAMTS13 activity, but others believe that more clinical research is needed before a well-informed decision can be made. Speakers in this session will review the evidence on both sides of the question and consider how to reach a definitive answer.",

					"SessionDescription": "Over the past 50 years, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular genetics that underlies pediatric acute leukemia. This information has come from a variety of different lines of investigation, including cytogenetics and genomic sequencing efforts to identify the underlying lesions, as well as functional studies in cellular and murine model systems to characterize the biological consequences of the identified genetic alterations. The detailed understanding that has emerged from these studies has served as the foundation for efforts to individualize treatment so that each child with leukemia has the best possible chance for a cure.</p>\n<p>Although our understanding of the landscape of somatic and germline mutations underlying acute leukemia has rapidly progressed, it remains incomplete. Moreover, why some patients respond to current therapeutic approaches and are cured, whereas others relapse and ultimately succumb to their disease remains a mystery. Fortunately, recent advancements in our ability to sequence leukemias at both a population and a single cell level are beginning to shed light on the diverse mechanisms that can lead to refractory disease.</p>\n<p>This lecture will focus on the progress that has been made over the last 15 years in advancing our understanding of pediatric acute leukemia and the impact this information is having on our ability to further increase cure rates.",

					"SessionDescription": "Serological assays, which have been implemented over the past five decades, have proven to be effective for screening out donors who are chronically infected with the classic transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases (TTIDs), such as syphilis, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus types I and II. However, over the past 15 years nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) screening has proven to be the preferred option for detection of many emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that generally cause acute infections. These EIDs include parvovirus B19, hepatitis E virus, babesia, and multiple transfusion-transmitted arboviruses, such as West Nile, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Such infections are effectively interdicted by NAT, whereas serological testing is ineffective and would detect high rates of donors with resolved infections. This session will review the evolution of responses to TTIDs, with a focus on the global Zika virus epidemic, and will highlight why ongoing surveillance for and rapid response to EIDs, optimally with sensitive multiplexed NAT assays, is critical to maintaining global blood safety.",

					"SessionDescription": "Early trials of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy reported clear patient benefits, but the trials also highlighted the limitations and risks of the first generation integrating vectors. In order to improve the safety and efficacy of gene transfer, a new integrating vector system was developed starting from HIV. The outcome of these efforts was lentiviral vectors that showed robust gene transfer and improved safety in several preclinical models. They have since become one of the most widely used gene transfer tools in biomedical research. More recently, upon entering clinical testing in HSC and T-cell gene therapy, lentiviral vectors are providing a long-sought hope of cure for some human diseases without satisfying treatments. Current results from ongoing HSC gene therapy trials for several different indications show substantial therapeutic benefits. The inherited disorders of hemoglobin represent the most common monogenic disease, and it has been estimated that around 7 percent of humans are carrying one of the mutations responsible for these disorders. Patients affected by thalassemia major and sickle cell anemia have stably become transfusion-independent and completely asymptomatic upon lentiviral HSC gene therapy. Near-complete genetic engineering of hematopoiesis has been achieved without clinical or molecular signs of adverse effects of vector insertion to the latest follow up, reaching up to nine years in the earliest treated patients. In-depth analysis of the genomic landscape of vector insertion shows a picture of polyclonal multi-lineage reconstitution of hematopoiesis without emergence of expanding clones, consistent with efficient engraftment of transduced HSC. These findings validate the predictions from preclinical models and support improved efficacy and safety of lentiviral vectors as compared to earlier generation vectors. If safety and efficacy are confirmed in more patients and upon longer follow-up, autologous HSC gene therapy may eventually become a preferred option over allogenic HSC transplantation.</p>\n<p>Dr. Luigi Naldini will review the development of lentiviral vectors and the molecular analyses showing safe and efficient HSC gene transfer in preclinical and clinical studies.</p>\n<p>Dr. Marina Cavazzana will review the current stage of clinical application and benefit of HSC gene transfer by lentiviral vectors.",

Unfortunately, many primary hematologists and transplant specialists find this multiplicity of options confusing or intimidating, and they are finding it more difficult than ever to counsel patients about which transplant path is best.</p>\n<p>The development of reduced-intensity and nonmyeloablative conditioning has also made it increasingly possible to perform alloHCT in older patients, with overall survival rates steadily improving. Most centers are now comfortable transplanting selected septuagenarians following comorbidity screening. Despite these advances, population studies demonstrate that even for widely supported indications (e.g., autologous HCT for myeloma and alloHCT for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia) only a minority of suitable patients ever reach a transplant. Thus, the issue of barriers to transplant remains a critical problem. This spotlight session will highlight these critical issues of donor graft selection and the barriers that limit transplant access and utilization.</p>\n<p>Dr. Daniel Weisdorf will discuss the array of donor and graft choices available for alloHCT recipients and discuss principles that should govern clinical decision making.</p>\n<p>Dr. Navneet Majhail will place recent advances in the context of remaining barriers to HCT that can be improved by coordinated efforts of referring hematologists and HCT clinicians.",

In this lecture, Dr. Giampaolo Merlini will discuss the advances in understanding the multifaceted molecular mechanisms of amyloid disease and the complexity of its management. The distinct biology of the amyloidogenic clone and its vulnerability to specific drugs will be presented together with genetic changes that modulate treatment response. Dr. Merlini will outline the vital importance of early diagnosis, when target organ damage is still recoverable, following intervention. Furthermore, he will describe the central role of cardiac biomarkers in the management of AL amyloidosis – from diagnosis to risk stratification and assessment of response to therapy. The complexity and pitfalls of the diagnostic procedure will be illustrated. Patients are fragile and highly sensitive to treatment toxicity, requiring a risk-adapted approach which will be discussed in the context of several effective anti-clone drugs and regimens now available. Early cardiac death still occurs in nearly one-third of very high-risk patients and is a major, unresolved clinical problem. Novel drugs are enriching the therapeutic landscape, and immunotherapies aimed at accelerating the reabsorption of amyloid deposits are under evaluation in several clinical trials. The future lies in combination therapy, with anti-clone therapy combined with newer treatments holding promise of further improving survival in this very treatable disease.",

Cell culture-based methods are used to interrogate memory B cell repertoires and to isolate antibodies selected on the basis of their neutralizing potency and breadth. These antibodies are candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of infections and represent useful tools for vaccine design. The genealogical analysis of B cell clones is used to dissect the role of somatic mutations in affinity maturation, diversification, and in the generation of autoantibodies.

This interactive workshop is not disease specific but will consider common themes related to aging in multiple settings. The workshop will include research on stem cells and aging, implications of aging on immune function (immunosenescence, immune reconstitution), thrombosis and aging, and correlates of frailty in hematology. Topics will cut across basic and clinical areas, as well as across disease types and clinical fields. Emphasis will be made on biologic mechanisms and implications for translation of clinical observations to pre-clinical models. The target audience for this workshop is laboratory-based investigators and clinical researchers with an interest in aging and hematology. The expansive content, thematic focus, and interactive format will also appeal to a broader audience including students and trainees.</p>\n<p>Workshop Objectives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a forum within ASH for presentation of novel research related to the biology of aging and hematologic disorders</li>\n<li>Promote discussion of a research agenda: what are the highest priority questions and new approaches needed to answer them?</li>\n<li>Highlight opportunities for collaboration.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This interactive workshop will feature brief didactic presentations from speakers on key topics followed by a few minutes of Q&A.",

					"SessionDescription": "Accurate case definition of anemia is critical for clinical diagnosis, to enable patient care, and for understanding the epidemiology of this problem to plan public health interventions. Appropriate definitions of anemia are therefore crucial for both clinical and public health medicine. Current hemoglobin thresholds the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends for men, women, young children, and pregnancy were proposed in 1968. However, concerns have been raised about the suitability of the current thresholds. WHO, in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are reviewing the evidence underlying current thresholds and undertaking a program of research to help ensure these thresholds are appropriate. The hematology community comprise the most important clinical stakeholder group and are the group with technical expertise to support this program. It is therefore crucial that hematologists have an opportunity to be informed about and to provide input into this process. This workshop will present key scientific data underlying the process, and will provide an open forum for hematologists to discuss the data and further research plans. It will also provide a forum for new basic science and epidemiology surrounding anemia at the clinical and population health level to be presented and discussed.<span> </span></p>\n<p>Workshop Objectives:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>To outline the rationale and process for review and revision of the WHO hemoglobin thresholds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>To identify and present key data which could provide the evidence that would be needed to define WHO hemoglobin thresholds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>To present key scientific and experimental data which may inform the process by which hemoglobin thresholds should be defined by WHO.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Deliver a highly interactive workshop, with a strong focus on collaboration between the hematology community and the WHO process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>To provide feedback to WHO from the hematology community based on discussions and outcomes of the meeting.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The format of this workshop will comprise an overview of the problem and the topic, followed by a series of didactic presentations accompanied by time for questions and answers. This will include both a series of public health related research presentations focusing on anemia, as well as basic biology/ laboratory based presentations focusing on iron metabolism and erythroid biology as it relates to this question. Both data presented at the WHO meeting held in Geneva and supporting, basic data will be presented. At the conclusion of the presentations, the chairs will summarize the key points presented, and allow further time for more general questions and answers, followed by a final summing up. This workshop is directed at laboratory-based investigators, clinicians, trainee hematologists interested in anemia and individuals interested in the guideline development process at the World Health Organization.",

					"SessionDescription": "The area of immunotherapy in lymphoid malignancies has exploded in recent years.  Multiple new immune therapies are in development in lymphoproliferative diseases, and this exciting progress has been due to an increased understanding of the tumor microenvironment and tumor-immune interactions in these diseases.  This proliferation of scientific knowledge has led to multiple potential new treatments including new immune checkpoint blockade therapies, novel T-cell approaches, agents targeting monocytes and macrophages, as well as new approaches inhibiting immune receptors and cytokine signaling.  The Workshop on Tumor Immune Interactions in Lymphoid Malignancies is directed at scientists, researchers, industry partners and clinicians interested in immune approaches for the management of lymphoid malignancies</p>\n<p>Workshop Objectives</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Highlight novel basic science and translational immune research in lymphoid malignancies that are likely to translate in the near future to clinically relevant therapies, biomarkers, or correlative science.</li>\n<li>Highlight potential future therapies or therapeutic targets that are likely to be important in lymphoid malignancies.</li>\n<li>To have scientists, translational researchers, and clinicians “hear it here first” when it comes to the next big thing in the management of lymphoid diseases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The format of this workshop will be different from sessions in the annual ASH meeting in that it will be strictly immune focused, highly interactive and somewhat speculative (though based on science), with a strong focus on future translation to the clinic.",

Parallel advances have defined epigenetic mechanisms regulating normal and malignant hematopoiesis. These insights have provided the framework and expanded the spectrum of novel therapeutic targets in hematologic malignancies. This session will span from biology to clinical translation of therapies modulating chromatin in cancer and other diseases. </p>\n<p>Dr. Richard Young will discuss recent insights into the roles of chromatin structure in health and disease. Chromosomes have DNA, RNA, and protein components that form chromatin, which has essential roles in gene control. </p>\n<p>Dr. Margaret Goodell will discuss the mechanisms through which DNA methylation, in particular, helps orchestrate stem cell differentiation as well as the cross-talk with other elements that control gene expression. The frequent mutation of epigenetic regulators observed in most hematologic malignancies has revealed their critical roles in ensuring normal blood development.</p>\n<p>Dr. James Bradner will examine the remarkable progress in the optimization and translation of chromatin-targeting small molecules in cancer and, increasingly, in non-malignant hematologic diseases. The convergence of advances in epigenomic analysis, human genetics, and chemical biology have focused coordinated efforts in drug discovery around chromatin-associated protein complexes.",

In this session, we will hear several examples for genes causing diseases in a heterozygous state. The clinical phenotype of patients can be variable and I would like to emphasis that patients with primary immunodeficiency might not only be diagnosed during childhood but also as young adults or adults because of complications as cancer or autoimmunity.</p>\n<p>Dr. Anne Durandy will start this session with a talk focusing on the clinical and immunological phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of recently molecularly characterized PADs, among them the activated PI3K delta syndromes (APDS) and the NFkB-deficiencies.</p>\n<p>Dr. Troy Torgerson will present the current therapeutic approaches used to treat disorders associated with dysfunction in the regulatory T cell and will discuss insights gained by characterizing these PID into Treg development and function.</p>\n<p>Dr. Jennifer Puck will present examples for diagnoses made for infants discovered to have T cell insufficiency by newborn screening.

					"SessionDescription": "Advances in genomic characterization, drug development, and clinical trials have led to the development of novel, effective, molecularly targeted therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In recent years, our understanding of how to develop mechanism-based targeted therapies has expanded; and novel approaches targeting malignancy-specific gene regulatory and differentiation features are also showing significant promise. This session will focus on recent advances in the development of targeted therapies aimed at specific molecular drivers, epigenetic alterations, and aberrant differentiation, each of which can be leveraged for novel therapeutic approaches against hematologic malignancies.</p>\n<p>Dr. Neil Shah will discuss the development of molecularly targeted therapies against mutant, constitutively activated tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) as well as more recent efforts to target <i>FLT3</i> in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He will review the current status of drug development, molecular determinants of drug sensitivity and resistance, and novel approaches to prevent and reverse kinase inhibitor resistance.</p>\n<p>Dr. Mark Dawson will discuss the challenges and opportunities of targeting the epigenome for therapeutic gain in hematologic malignancies. Given that the dynamic plasticity of the epigenome lends itself well to therapeutic manipulation, the past few years have witnessed an unprecedented investment in the development, characterization, and translation of targeted epigenetic therapies. Several of these epigenetic therapies have now transitioned into the clinical arena, and emerging evidence suggests that these drugs are well tolerated and show single agent efficacy in a range of hematopoietic cancers. The enduring challenge for clinicians and scientists will be to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern sensitivity and resistance to these agents. In this session, Dr. Dawson will provide an overview of the new epigenetic therapies currently being evaluated in clinical trials, their molecular and cellular mechanism of action, and the pre-clinical evidence for their therapeutic efficacy. He will also highlight the emerging evidence for how therapeutic resistance may develop and what future combination strategies may increase the clinical value of this class of drugs.</p>\n<p>Dr. Kimberly Stegmaier will discuss targeting the differentiation as a therapy approach in AML. Impaired myeloid differentiation, whether due to disordered genetics or epigenetics, is a defining feature in AML. While most patients with AML will be treated with high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients with the most successfully treated subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), are treated with the pro-differentiating agents all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide. These drugs target the defining lesion in APL, the PML-RARα fusion gene, overcoming PML-RARα-induced transcriptional repression to induce neutrophilic maturation. Other subtypes of AML have been demonstrated to maintain the molecular machinery necessary for differentiation – and newer drugs, including modulators of epigenetic regulators and signal transduction, have more recently been reported to induce AML differentiation. This presentation will focus on the history of differentiation therapy in AML as well as promising recent advances in the field.",

					"SessionDescription": "Hematologic malignancies, like other cancers, have underlying genomic instability, resulting in important clinical consequences. On the one hand, genomic instability leads to a more aggressive cellular phenotype, resulting in chromosome translocations, tumor suppressor gene inactivation, and amplification of drug-resistant genes. On the other hand, genomic instability is caused by defects in DNA repair, resulting in the heightened sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy and radiation.</p>\n<p>Dr. Andre Nussenzweig will discuss the wide array of recurrent, non-random chromosome translocations that are found in some secondary leukemias. These translocations often arise following the use of DNA topoisomerase inhibitors. These topoisomerase cleavage complex-dependent DNA breakage sites are distinct from other known chromosome fragile sites because they are independent of transcription, DNA replication, and cell type. Dr. Nussenzweig will characterize these novel sites of translocation and describe how they are related to the overall three dimensional organization of chromosomes. </p>\n<p>Dr. Alan D'Andrea will review the major DNA repair pathways and DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Inherited mutations in these pathways underlie numerous leukemia and bone marrow failure syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, and ataxia telangiectasia. New agents that modulate DNA repair, such as poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and checkpoint kinase inhibitors, are now entering the clinic.</p>\n<p>Dr. Feyruz Rassool will discuss the emerging use of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of cancers that have an underlying defect in homologous recombination DNA repair. Recent studies indicate that PARP inhibitor efficacy can be enhanced through novel drug combinations. Dr. Rassool will describe how a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor in combination with the PARP inhibitor talazoparib can modulate DNA repair and lead to enhanced activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She will discuss results from a phase I clinical trial evaluating this combination for AML, along with its correlative studies.",

					"SessionDescription": "Adhering to evidence-based clinical guidelines is recognized by both medical practitioners and administrators as a key pathway to improving quality of care, whether in complex, distributed health care systems or in community-based practices. Yet despite the demonstrated advantages that guidelines provide in the context of care delivery, implementing recommendations is fraught with potential pitfalls. Culture, cost, and complexity are chief among a variety of barriers to successful implementation of evidence-based pathways and clinical guidelines. Notwithstanding these challenges, real-world examples have established that implementation is achievable across a variety of clinical settings. These issues are especially important in hematology, as both malignant and non-malignant hematologic disorders are uncommon and complex.</p>\n<p>This session will explore issues related to the implementation of evidence-based pathways and clinical guidelines, examine research supporting effective strategies for developing implementation methodologies, and review practical examples of successful implementation of pathways or guidelines in large-scale clinical settings.  The session will include practical takeaways for immediate use by practitioners and administrators alike.",

					"SessionDescription": "New therapeutic approaches to treat bleeding and thrombosis due to a variety of pathological conditions are needed. This session will present new biochemical findings into the hemostatic system that have unveiled promising molecular targets to treat these conditions. These strategies include targeting the protein C pathway for hemophilia, selectively inhibiting platelet activation, and blocking the contact pathway to prevent thrombosis.</p>\n<p>Dr. James Huntington will explain his approach for targeting the protein C anticoagulant system. Blood coagulation is regulated by a complex network of pro- and anti-coagulant factors that work simultaneously to ensure rapid, stable clot formation at sites of vascular damage, while limiting clot grown to prevent thrombosis. Deficiency in pro-coagulant factors VIII and IX cause hemophilia A and B, respectively, and result in bleeding due to an imbalanced hemostatic system. All current treatments aim to rebalance the system by replacing the missing factors or by adding other pro-coagulant factors. A more recent approach is to redress the imbalance by down-tuning anticoagulant forces. Anti-TFPI antibodies and an anti-antithrombin siRNA are in the clinic as treatments for hemophilia. Dr. Huntington will discuss how his lab designed a serpin that is specific for activated protein C (APC) over other clotting factors and will show preclinical data on efficacy and safety in mouse models.</p>\n<p>Dr. Steve Watson will discuss the role of the tyrosine kinase-linked receptors GPVI and CLEC-2 in hemostasis and thrombosis, and whether they represent novel drug targets in thrombotic disease. The two receptors can be targeted by direct inhibition or through their tyrosine kinase-driven signalling pathways. Inhibitors of Src, Syk, and Tec family kinases have recently entered the clinic or are under clinical development. There is particular interest in the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib and in the next generation of inhibitors because of their irreversible action. By analogy to aspirin, this offers the potential of using a low dose of ibrutinib to selectively inhibit platelet activation. Unexpectedly, ibrutinib selectively inhibits platelet activation by CLEC-2 relative to GPVI. The molecular basis of this will be discussed.</p>\n<p>Dr. David Gailani will discuss the roles of the plasma proteins prekallikrein, factor XII, and factor XI (the contact factors) in thrombosis, with an emphasis on coagulation induced by artificial surfaces (e.g., extracorporeal circuits and implantable devices). Given the limited contributions of these proteins to hemostasis, it is anticipated that antithrombotics targeting them would be associated with a low risk of bleeding. Recent work suggests that the contact factors express protease activity in their single-chain precursor forms. This activity may serve as a trigger for the contact system when blood is exposed to a surface.",

					"SessionDescription": "Aging is a risk factor for thrombosis, yet the molecular and functional changes that occur during aging to drive this increased risk remain poorly understood.  As the number of older adults is predicted to continue to rise, this will become an increasingly common public health problem, with associated morbidity and mortality.  Filling these knowledge gaps is critical for improving the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis in older adults.\n\nDr. Rondina will discuss changes in the platelet molecular signature that occur during human aging.  He will highlight ongoing work on dissecting the regulation and function of specific genes whose expression are altered in older adults and impacting thrombo-inflammation.\n\nDr. Wolberg will discuss In vitro and in vivo models used to dissect the pathophysiology of thrombosis in aging.  She will highlight how these models recapitulate, in some settings, human thrombosis and provide insights into the pathobiology of thrombosis in aging.\n\nDr. Davizon-Castillo is an emerging young investigator who will discuss his ongoing work dissecting how inflammation during aging results in a hyper-active platelet phenotype, causing enhanced thrombosis that is TNF-alpha driven.  He will also highlight how RNA sequencing of megakaryocytes in aging yields discoveries on molecular reprogramming driving altered platelet function and thrombo-inflammation.",
